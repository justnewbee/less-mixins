less-mixins
===

version: 0.0.0

not done with it yet

the less mixins i wrote or collected for ref

in the process of developing some project, i created a bunch of less-mixins, some are created from scratch, some are copied from other developer. i feel obliged to make one of my own mixin library, it's not that i want to make it some standard, but for quick reference.
